The scripts are developed using text substitution techniques. 
These techniques are: 

1. Keyword substitution. Openstack configuration parameters are defined 
to have initial value string at first. These value string would then be subsituted
by user-defined environment variables' values. 

2. Multi-Level substitution. This is the second round of sustituion on a task 
such as adding a new compute node. 

3. Generic files. These are files which a number of parameters are left out 
for future substitution. The left out parameters are called generic parameters.  
This technique is used with the Multi-level substitution above.
